## üßæ Description
SecLists is a collection of multiple types of lists used during security assessments. This project includes usernames, passwords, URLs, sensitive data patterns, fuzzing payloads, web shells, and many more. These lists can be leveraged by security professionals and enthusiasts for penetration testing and security research.

- [SecLists GitHub Repository](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)

## ü§∏ Examples
1. **Common Passwords List**:
    - `/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10k-most-common.txt`
    - This file contains the 10k most common passwords that can be used for brute force attacks.

2. **Username List**:
    - `/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt`
    - A concise list of commonly used usernames for use in username enumeration or brute force attacks.

3. **Fuzzing Payloads**:
    - `/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt`
    - A list of common directory names and files to be used in web content discovery.

4. **Sensitive Data Patterns**:
    - `/Pattern-Matching/regex.json`
    - JSON file with regular expressions for detecting sensitive data such as credit card numbers or Social Security numbers in text.

5. **Web Shells**:
    - `/Web-Shells/php-reverse-shell.php`
    - A PHP script that provides a reverse shell back to the attacker's machine.
    
These examples demonstrate the variety and utility of lists contained within the SecLists repository for different phases of security testing and research.
